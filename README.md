# conditional_logit_foreign_risk
I use a mixed logit model with year-fixed effects and country-random effects under L2 regularization to predict likelihoods of sovereign external debt defaults for out-of-sample years. I combine these predicted probabilities with estimated haircut data to generate a risk score which is interpreted as the unconditional rate of foreign investment loss resulting from default.
