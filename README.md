# mixed-panel-logit-default-risk
I use a mixed panel logit model with randomized coefficients across countries and year-fixed effects under L2 regularization to predict unconditional probabilities of sovereign external debt default for out-of-sample years. 

For future research, I wish to combine predicted probabilities of default with estimated "haircut" data to generate a risk score which may be interpreted as the unconditional rate of foreign investment loss resulting from default.
