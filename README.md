# mixed_logit_foreign_risk
I use a mixed logit model with year-fixed effects and country-specific random effects under L2 regularization to predict unconditional probabilities of sovereign external debt default for out-of-sample years. I combine these predicted probabilities with estimated haircut data to generate a risk score which is interpreted as the unconditional rate of foreign investment loss resulting from default.
